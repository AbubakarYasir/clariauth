📜 Conditions and Regulations of Jihād in the Path of Allah

🎙️ Shaykh, the esteemed scholar Dr. Ṣāliḥ al-Suḥaymī – Mufti of the Noble City of Madinah

📜 Conditions and Regulations of Jihād in the Path of Allah:

1. Sincerity – it must be solely for the sake of Allah.


2. In accordance with the Sunnah – based on the guidance of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).


3. Under the banner of the Muslim ruler (Wālī al-Amr) – not independently or rebelliously.


4. With the permission of the parents – especially if they are in need of the person.


5. Preponderant belief in achieving victory – not a suicidal or reckless act.


6. Under a Sunni banner – not based on partisanship or sectarianism.


7. The Muslims must possess strength and protection – so that the army and the Muslim population are not destroyed.

*Ṣāliḥ said in al-Masāil (204): And I asked him (Aḥmad bin Ḥanbal) about a man who works with (weaving) palm leaves and does not earn except what suffices him—should he go ahead with marriage? My father said: He should go ahead with marriage for Allah will provide for her (his wife). He also said: He should marry and ask for loan (to marry). And if he has two hundred dirhams enough for Hajj while he fears upon himself Fitnah (temptation), I command him to marry and not do Hajj.*

I asked Ubai bin Ka`b, "O Abu AlMundhir! Your brother, Ibn Mas`ud said so-and-so (i.e., the two Mu'awwidh-at do not belong to the Qur'an)." Ubai said, "I asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) about them, and he said, 'They have been revealed to me, and I have recited them (as a part of the Qur'an)," So Ubai added, "So we say as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) has said."

13/04/2025, 6:17 pm - Alfaaz: *Being persistent on a minor sin without repenting turns it to a major sin as Allah says: _“and they do not persist in what they did while they know.”_ [Āl 'Imrān 3:135]. Major sins require repentance as He says: _“If you avoid the major sins which you are forbidden from, we shall expiate from your minor sins and admit you to a noble entrance”_* [al-Nisā 4:31]


عَنْ سَعِيدِ بْنِ جُبَيْرٍ أَنَّ رَجُلا سَأَلَ ابْنَ عَبَّاسٍ: كَمِ الْكَبَائِرُ؟ سَبْعاً هِيَ؟ قَالَ: هِيَ إِلَى سَبْعمِائَةٍ أَقْرَبُ مِنْهَا إِلَى سَبْعٍ، وَأَنَّهُ لَا كَبِيرَةَ مَعَ اسْتِغْفَارٍ وَلا صَغِيرَةَ مَعَ إِصْرَارٍ _[تفسير ابن أبي حاتم (٤/١٩٢) بإسناد حسن]_

*Sa'īd bin Jubayr narrated that a man asked Ibn Abbas: How many are the major sins? Are they seven? He said: They are closer to seven hundred than seven, and that there is no major sin with seeking forgiveness and no minor sin with persistence.*

13/04/2025, 7:57 pm - Muzammil New: Just to clarify the Ḥadīth says

And where is the oppression that, if a person utters a single word in support of, or praises the Ṭawāġīt, or argues on their behalf, this would cause him to leave Islām—even if he is fasting and standing in prayer—compare to the oppression that does not take one out of Islām?

The Messenger of Allah ﷺ  said:
*“Whoever prays Fajr - or he said: the morning prayer - and sits in his place and does not engage in any worldly matter, and remembers Allah until he prays Ḍuḥá four raka'āt, he will emerge from his sins like the day his mother gave birth to him, without any sin.”*

14/04/2025, 4:33 pm - Mohamed Ahmed Abdulwahab: *Being persistent on a minor sin without repenting turns it to a major sin as Allah says: _“and they do not persist in what they did while they know.”_ [Āl 'Imrān 3:135]. Major sins require repentance as He says: _“If you avoid the major sins which you are forbidden from, we shall expiate from your minor sins and admit you to a noble entrance”_* [al-Nisā 4:31]


عَنْ سَعِيدِ بْنِ جُبَيْرٍ أَنَّ رَجُلا سَأَلَ ابْنَ عَبَّاسٍ: كَمِ الْكَبَائِرُ؟ سَبْعاً هِيَ؟ قَالَ: هِيَ إِلَى سَبْعمِائَةٍ أَقْرَبُ مِنْهَا إِلَى سَبْعٍ، وَأَنَّهُ لَا كَبِيرَةَ مَعَ اسْتِغْفَارٍ وَلا صَغِيرَةَ مَعَ إِصْرَارٍ _[تفسير ابن أبي حاتم (٤/١٩٢) بإسناد حسن]_

*Sa'īd bin Jubayr narrated that a man asked Ibn Abbas: How many are the major sins? Are they seven? He said: They are closer to seven hundred than seven, and that there is no major sin with seeking forgiveness and no minor sin with persistence.*

A brother mentioned the Ḥadīth regarding the virtue of praying Fajr in congregation at Friday is weak as ibn Ḥibbān said regarding al-Walīd bin 'Abd al-Raḥmān: *“His hearing from Abū Umāmah and others from the Ṣaḥābah is not proven”* [Mashāhīr 'ulamā al-Amṣār p. 292]

Therefore we have deleted it even though there are some scholars that authenticated this but it being weak appears to be the correct opinion

24/04/2025, 9:54 am - Muzammil New: The Poem that Made Imam Ahmad cry (rahimahullah)

A man once came to Imām Ahlus-Sunnah, Ahmad bin Hanbal and asked him, “O Imām, what is your opinion on poetry?”

He replied, “Which poetry is this?” to which the man responded by reciting the following couplets:

إذا ما قال لي ربي اما استحييت تعصيني
If my Lord asks me, “Have you shyness in disobeying me?

وتخفي الذنب عن خلقي وبالعصيان تأتيني
You conceal your sins from my creation – and with sins you come to me.”

 *Imām Ahmad took these lines and repeated them over and over again, and wept profusely to such an extent that one his students said that he almost perished due to him crying so much.* 

“If my Lord asks me…”

إذا ما قال لي ربي اما استحييت تعصيني

If my Lord asks me, “Have you shyness in disobeying me?

وتخفي الذنب عن خلقي وبالعصيان تأتيني

You conceal your sins from my creation – and with sins you come to me.”

فكيف أجيبُ يا ويحي ومن ذا سوف يحميني؟

So how will I answer? O woe to me – and who shall protect me?

أسُلي النفس بالآمالِ من حينٍ الى حيني

I keep averting my soul with thoughts of hope – from time to time.

وأنسى ما وراءُ الموت ماذا بعد تكفيني

And I forget what is to come after death – and what is to come after I am shrouded.

كأني قد ضّمنتُ العيش ليس الموت يأتيني

As if I am guaranteed life (eternally) – and that death will not come to me.

وجائت سكرة الموتُ الشديدة من سيحميني

And when the severe stupor of death overtakes me – who will protect me?

نظرتُ الى الوُجوهِ أليـس منُهم من سيفدينـــي

I looked at the faces; is there not from amongst them who will ransom me?

سأسأل ما الذي قدمت في دنياي ينجيني

I will be asked regarding what I have prepared in my life to save me (on the Day of Judgement).

فكيف إجابتي من بعد ما فرطت في ديني

Then how will I answer – after I have neglected my religion.

ويا ويحي ألــــم أسمع كلام الله يدعوني

Woe to me! Did I not hear the Speech of Allāh inviting me?

ألــــم أسمع لما قد جاء في قاف ويسِ

Did I not hear what came in (the chapters of) Qāf and Yā-Sīn?

ألـــم أسمع بيوم الحشر يوم الجمع و الديني

Did I not hear about the Day of Gathering, the Day of Assemble and the Day of Judgement?

ألـــم أسمع مُنادي الموت يدعوني يناديني

Did I not hear the crier of death inviting me, calling me?

فيا ربــــاه عبدُ تــائبُ من ذا سيؤويني

So O my Lord, a slave (turning to you) I have repented – so who then shall shelter me?

سوى رب غفور واسعُ للحقِ يهديني

Except a Lord extensive in forgiveness – to the truth He will guide me.

أتيتُ إليكَ فارحمني وثقــّـل في موازيني

I have come to you (in repentance) – so have mercy on me, and make heavy my scales (with good deeds).

وخفَفَ في جزائي أنتَ أرجـى من يجازيني

And lighten my account – You are the best of who will bring me to account.

وقال الحافظ أبو يعلى : حدثنا إسحاق بن أبي إسرائيل ، حدثنا حجاج بن محمد ، عن هشام بن زياد ، عن الحسن قال : سمعت أبا هريرة يقول : قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم : " من قرأ يس في ليلة أصبح مغفورا له . ومن قرأ : " حم " التي فيها الدخان أصبح مغفورا له "

Abu Ya'la narrated in his Musnad from Abu Hurayrah that the Rasool صلى الله عليه وسلم said:

Whoever reads Yaseen in the night, he will wake up forgiven and whoever reads the Ha-mim in which here is the smoke (Surah Dukhan), he will wake forgiven.

Ibn Kathir said: Its isnad is jayyid (good/excellent)

24/04/2025, 10:40 pm - Muzammil New: *Here we distinguish between proven and unproven quotes/narrations*
*[Males only]*

1) Try to send the quote (Arabic preferably) in text form

2) Try to mention how you want the answer to be beforehand (summarised, takhrīj, scan, voice message etc) to avoid back and forth and wastage of time

3) You are allowed only one question within 24H as checking authenticity takes time

4) Avoid messages that are not related to authenticity. Take them to private 

5) Try to consolidate your question in one single message, be clear and unambiguous 

6) Try to search (and mention) the reference beforehand (if possible) to reduce workload on the answerer. Please do not ask about quotes generated by AI

7) Wait for the answer instead of tagging/reminders as they will not give a quicker reply

*Note:* There can be a difference of opinion on the grading but I won't necessarily mention it.
Corrections are welcome privately

Is this authentic? Also, is there any doubtful person in the Isnād? And I'd highly appreciate if you can give the takhreej

Sunan Abi Dawud 2140
Narrated Qays ibn Sa'd:

I went to al-Hirah and saw them (the people) prostrating themselves before a satrap of theirs, so I said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has most right to have prostration made before him. When I came to the Prophet (ﷺ), I said: I went to al-Hirah and saw them prostrating themselves before a satrap of theirs, but you have most right, Messenger of Allah, to have (people) prostrating themselves before you. He said: Tell me , if you were to pass my grave, would you prostrate yourself before it? I said: No. He then said: Do not do so. If I were to command anyone to make prostration before another I would command women to prostrate themselves before their husbands, because of the special right over them given to husbands by Allah.

The Prohibition Of Drinking Whilst Standing

‎قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم : لو يعلم الذي يشرب وهو قائم ما في بطنه لاستقاء.

A small reminder regarding the group’s rules:
Kindly refrain from discussing or explaining the authenticity (tahqeeq/takhrij) of the matters raised here in the group.

If any brother has beneficial research or information regarding authenticity, he may kindly send it privately (in DMs) to Brother Muzammil @⁨Muzammil New⁩ 

The group is designated for Muzammil to explain and share his opinions regarding authenticity, along with any admins he has authorized, bi-idhnillah.

We hope the brothers will cooperate with this guideline for the benefit of all, and may Allah reward you all for your eagerness to spread knowledge with wisdom and order.

Even though our brother Muzammil, حفظه الله, is able to find narrations on various topics, this group has been specifically set up for the ikhwaan to ask about "narrations" they have heard or seen, and to receive the grading and explanation from Muzammil himself.

Therefore, we kindly request that general questions or broader topic requests be sent to him privately (via DMs).

If he wishes to share something beneficial more broadly, he will, إن شاء الله, post it himself in his WhatsApp community "Treasures of Salaf".

We ask Allah to bless us and you all with sincerity and benefit.

بارك الله فيكم وجزاكم الله خيرا على تعاونكم.

*“It is written in the wisdom of the family of Dāwūd: It is an obligation upon the sane person not become heedless (or inattentive) about four hours. An hour in which he privately speaks with his Lord. An hour in which he holds himself to account. An hour in which he is alone with his brothers who inform him about his mistakes and tell him the truth about himself. And an hour in which he is alone with his soul and what pleases it from what is allowed and praised. Because this hour will aid him in (performing) those hour and it is a relaxation for the hearts. And it is an obligation for the sane person, that he is not seen departing except for (one of) three: A supply for a meeting (with Allāh), acquiring his livelihood or a pleasure in something which is not forbidden. And it is an obligation upon the sane person that he is knowledgeable about his time, preserving of his tongue and attending to his affairs.”*

My mother saw (a dream) when she conceived me that a light issued forth from her which illuminated the palaces of Baṣrà in the land of Shām. I was nursed among the tribe of Banū Sa‘d ibn Bakr. While I was with a brother of mine amongst our (young flock), two men in white garments came to me, and they carried with them a bowl of ice-cold water. They laid me down, opened my abdomen, extracted my heart, split it open, and removed from it a black clot, which they cast aside. Then they washed my heart and my abdomen with that ice-cold water until they purified it and restored them to how they had been. One of them then said to his companion, “Weigh him against ten of his Ummah,” and they weighed me against ten and I outweighed them. Then he then said, “Weigh him against a thousand of his Ummah,” and they weighed me against a thousand, and I outweighed them. He said, “Leave him be, for if you were  to weigh him against all his (entire) Ummah, he would outweigh them*

The one who is preoccupied by an affair away from Allāh will have it become a calamity upon him.

Whomsoever gives precedence to other than Allāh will not be blessed in it.

Whomsoever pleases other than Him, at the expense of angering Allāh, Allah will cause them to become discontent with him, and that is guaranteed."

And these major, fundamental violations through which Al-Huwayni opposed the Usool of the Manhaj of the Salaf al-Salih—the People of Hadith and Athar—and instead aligned with the Usool of the Qutbis-Surooris-Khariji methodology are:

First Violation: His Takfir of the one who persists in sin 

Second Violation: His haste in declaring others disbelievers without adhering to the guidelines of Ahl al-Sunnah

Third Violation: Huwaynis upholding of the slogan of Sayyid Qutb in his book Ma’aalim Fi Dariiq : “The most specific characteristic of Tawheed al-Ilaahiyyah is Tawheed al-Haakimiyyah.”  …and this is a slogan of the Qutbis and Surooris, who are the Khawarij of this era 

Fourth Violation: Al-Huwayni’s non-recognition of the legitimacy of the rule of Muslim leaders who came to power through dominance and force.

Fifth Violation: Al Huwayni’s taking the path of political agitation and inciting the public against rulers, which is the way of the Qa’idiyyah Khawaarij

Sixth Violation: Al Huwayni’s praise for the Qutbis and Sururis - the Khawaarij of this era - and (his praise) of storytellers

Seventh Violation: Al Huwayni’s stab against a group of senior scholars who are imams of the Salafi methodology in this era and his mockery of their fatwas.

Eight Violation: Al Huwayni’s endorsement (or affirmation) of the innovation of “the obligation of balancing the good and the bad when warning against a violator or innovator”

Ninth Violation: Al-Huwayni’s resemblance to storytellers in their ways.

04/05/2025, 1:56 pm - Muzammil New: ہر مسلمان کو چاہیے کہ وہ اس حدیث میں اپنا مقام پہچانے"مولانا عبیداللہ انور

"*نبی کریم صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم کی طرف سے غزہ کی عظیم قربانی کے بارے میں پیش گوئیاں*"

یہ پیش گوئیاں ہیں، جنہیں ہم میں سے بہت سے لوگ نہیں جانتے یا اُن سے چھپائی گئیں، اور یہ (غزہ کی قربانی) قیامت کے قریب کی نشانیوں میں سے ہے۔ یہ احادیث صحیح ہیں اور بہت سے راویوں نے رسول اللہ صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم سے روایت کی ہیں۔ میں یہاں سب سے اہم احادیث پیش کرتا ہوں تاکہ وہ دلوں کو سکون دے سکیں جو غم، جدائی اور حیرانی سے تھک چکے ہیں۔ انہیں دوسروں تک پھیلائیں، شاید یہ پڑھنے والوں کے لیے ٹھنڈک اور سلامتی بن جائے۔
اور غزہ والوں کو معلوم ہو کہ ان میں سے صابر لوگ جنت کے دولہے اور دولہنیں ہوں گے۔

اہم نوٹ:
*1947ء تک غزہ کو عسقلان کے بڑے علاقے کا حصہ سمجھا جاتا تھا، اور امام شافعی رحمہ اللہ کبھی خود کو "غزہ" کا اور کبھی "عسقلان" کا کہتے تھے*۔

---

🪷پہلی حدیث:
رسول اللہ صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم نے فرمایا:
"*عسقلان دونوں (عزیز) شہروں میں سے ایک ہے، وہاں سے قیامت کے دن ستر ہزار لوگ بغیر حساب کے اٹھائے جائیں گے، اور پچاس ہزار شہیدوں کی حالت میں، جو اللہ کے مہمان ہوں گے۔ وہاں شہداء کی صفیں ہوں گی، ان کے سَر ان کے ہاتھوں میں ہوں گے، رگوں سے خون بہہ رہا ہو گا، اور وہ کہیں گے: اے ہمارے رب! ہمیں وہ عطا کر جو تو نے اپنے رسولوں کے ذریعے ہم سے وعدہ فرمایا تھا، یقیناً تو وعدے کے خلاف نہیں کرتا۔ اللہ فرمائے گا: میرے بندوں نے سچ کہا، انہیں سفید نہر میں غسل دو۔ وہ اس سے پاک اور سفید ہو کر نکلیں گے اور جنت میں جہاں چاہیں گے گھومیں گے*۔"

---

🪷دوسری حدیث:
دارقطنی نے اپنی کتاب "المخرج على الصحيحين" میں ابن عمر رضی اللہ عنہ سے روایت کی،
کہ *نبی صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم ایک قبرستان پر نماز پڑھ رہے تھے، صحابہ نے پوچھا: یا رسول اللہ، یہ کون سا قبرستان ہے؟ آپ نے فرمایا: دشمن کی سرزمین پر ایک قبرستان، جسے "عسقلان" کہا جاتا ہے۔ میری امت کے کچھ لوگ اسے فتح کریں گے، اللہ وہاں سے ستر ہزار شہداء کو اٹھائے گا، اور ان میں سے ہر ایک شخص قبیلہ ربیعہ اور مضر جتنے لوگوں کی شفاعت کرے گا، اور ہر شہید کے لیے جنت کی دولہن ہو گی۔ عسقلان جنت کی دلہن ہے*۔

🪷تیسری حدیث:
سعید بن منصور نے اپنی "سنن" میں ابو النضر سے روایت کی،
کہ عوف بن مالک نبی صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم کے پاس آئے اور کہا: مجھے وصیت کیجیے۔ آپ نے فرمایا: *جبل الخمر کو لازم پکڑو۔ انہوں نے پوچھا: جبل الخمر کیا ہے؟ آپ نے فرمایا: وہ قیامت کا میدان (محشر کی زمین) ہے*۔
🪷اور عطا الخراساني سے روایت ہے:
*مجھے یہ بات پہنچی کہ رسول اللہ صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم نے تین بار فرمایا: اللہ اس قبرستان پر رحم فرمائے۔ صحابہ نے پوچھا: وہ کون سا قبرستان ہے؟ آپ نے فرمایا: وہ قبرستان جو عسقلان میں ہو گا*۔
چنانچہ تابعی عطاء بن أبی مسلم رحمہ اللہ ہر سال غزہ اور عسقلان میں چالیس دن تک قیام کیا کرتے تھے، یہاں تک کہ ان کا انتقال بیت المقدس میں ہوا۔

🍃*قیامت سے پہلے بڑی فتح دو عظیم باتوں سے جڑی ہوئی ہے*:

1. ایمان اور نفاق کے دو الگ الگ گروہ ظاہر ہوں گے

2. اور (بہت بڑی) خیانت اور بے وفائی

*اگر یہ تمام نفاق، دشمنی، اور سازش نہ ہوتیں تو ہمیں یقین نہ آتا کہ فتح اتنی قریب ہے — بلکہ وہ تو سورج کی طرح واضح ہو چکی ہے*۔

🪷لہٰذا، *ثابت قدم رہو اے لوگو*، یہ دن فیصلہ کن اور آشکار کرنے والے دن ہیں۔

*مبارک ہو تمہیں اے اہلِ غزہ*
اللہ تمہیں اپنی پناہ میں رکھے، تمہیں فتح دے،
🤲اے اللہ! اہل غزہ کی حفاظت فرما، ان کے قدموں کو ثابت رکھ، ان کے دلوں کو سکون دے، ان کے زخموں پر مرہم رکھ، ان کے نشانے درست کر، ان کا پرچم بلند کر، انہیں غم سے نجات دے، ان کے شہداء کو قبول فرما، ان کی کمزوری کو طاقت میں بدل دے، اور اپنی طرف سے مدد نازل فرما۔

*ان بشارتوں کو پھیلاؤ، انہیں اپنے پاس مت روکو، تاکہ اہلِ غزہ کو معلوم ہو کہ ان کا صبر، استقامت، اور نبی کریم صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم کی صداقت کا انعام کتنا عظیم ہے*۔

Ibn al-Qayyim said:
"The madhhab of Abu Hanifah in this matter is among the strictest of the madhhabs, and his position regarding it is the harshest of statements. His companions explicitly stated the prohibition of listening to all musical instruments, such as the flute, the duff (tambourine), and even striking with a stick. They declared it a sin that leads to fisq (open disobedience), and renders one’s testimony inadmissible. Even more severe than that, they said: 'Listening (to music) is fisq, and taking pleasure in it is disbelief (kufr).'"

هَا إِنَّ ها هُنَا لَعِلْماً جَمّاً (وَأَشَارَ بِيَدِهِ إِلى صَدره) لَوْ أَصَبْتُ لَهُ حَمَلَةً ! بَلَى أَصَبْتُ لَقِناً  غَيْرَ مَأْمُونٍ عَلَيْهِ، مُسْتَعْمِلاً آلَةَ الدِّينِ لِلدُّنْيَا، وَمُسْتَظْهِراً بِنِعَمَ اللهِ عَلَى عِبادِهِ، وَبِحُجَجِهِ عَلَى أَوْلِيَائِهِ، أَوْ مُنْقَاداً لِحَمَلَةِ الْحَقِّ  لاَ بَصِيرَةَ لَهُ فِي أَحْنَائِهِ  يَنْقَدِحُ الشَّكُّ فِي قَلْبِهِ لِأَوَّلِ عَارِضٍ مِنْ شُبْهَةٍ.

05/05/2025, 7:59 am - Muzammil New: "A majhool (unknown) narrator is one whose reliability is not established.

There are two types of majhool narrators:

1. A narrator who has only one student and whose reliability is not known through an authentic source. This type is also called majhool al-‘ayn.
2. A narrator who has more than one student but whose reliability is still not known through an authentic source. This type is called majhool al-haal or mastoor.

According to the stronger opinion, whether a narrator is majhool al-‘ayn or majhool al-haal (mastoor), his solitary narration is considered da‘eef (weak)."

Take not the Jews and the Christians as Awliyaa’ (friends, protectors, helpers), they are but Awliyaa’ of each other. And if any amongst you takes them (as Awliyaa’), then surely, he is one of them.

08/05/2025, 8:24 am - محمد عبد الوهاب: عن كنانة بن جبل قال: قال بكر بن عبد الله: إذا رأيت من هو أكبر منك فقل: هذا سبقني بالإيمان والعمل الصالح فهو خير مني، وإذا رأيت من هو أصغر منك فقل: سبقته إلى الذنوب والمعاصي فهو خير مني، وإذا رأيت إخوانك يكرمونك ويعظمونك فقل: هذا فضل أخذوا به، وإذا رأيت منهم تقصيراً فقل: هذا ذنب أحدثته.

ص146 - كتاب صفة الصفوة - بكر بن عبد الله المزني - المكتبة الشاملة

I found this but translates as 

From Kanānah ibn Jabal, he said: Bakr ibn ʿAbd Allāh said: "If you see someone older than you, say: ‘He preceded me in faith and righteous deeds, so he is better than me.’
If you see someone younger than you, say: ‘I preceded him in sins and disobedience, so he is better than me.’
If you see your brothers honoring and respecting you, say: ‘This is a favor they have been granted.’
And if you see shortcomings from them, say: ‘This is due to a sin I have committed.’"

I would like to know 

1. Is the hadith authentic, if not kindly elaborate the reason 
2. Shaikh Al bani had graded this Sahih. There were some hadith Shakh Al bani had graded and then changed its grading during his lifetime. Is this Hadith one of those

"I commit sins, and I know that Allāh is punishing me, however I don’t feel this punishment.

My wealth is still secured, and it keeps on increasing as it usually would, and the same about my family. 

God has opened for me all the doors of this world, and I am not prevented from attaining anything!" 

(basically flaunting that though he sins a lot, he is untouched by any divine punishment.)

Al-Hasan Al-Basri asked him: "Do you pray to your Lord in the night? (Qiyamul-Layl)

The man said: "No"

Al-Hasan said: *"That is enough of a punishment"*

Allah disclosed that for me (i.e. removed from me the reservations I had to fight) at the time of Salat al Zuhr and so I fought alongside Amir al Muʾminin. When he finished, I proceeded to Madinah. I came to Umm Salamah and said, ‘I have come, by Allah, not asking for food or drink; rather, I am the mawla (client) of Abu Dharr.’ She said, ‘Welcome.’ I told her my story and so she said, ‘Where were you when the hearts flew their course (i.e. when the fighting broke out)?’ I said, ‘I was such that Allah disclosed it for me (i.e. removed the reservations I had) at noon (and then I went to fight alongside Amir al Muʾminin).’ She said, ‘Excellent!

"By Allah, I have met more than seventy Companions who participated in Badr, most of their clothing was wool. If you saw them, you would think they are mad. And if they saw your best, they would say: 'These people will have no portion in the Hereafter'. And if they saw your worst, they would say: 'These do not believe in the Day of Reckoning.'" 

وَاللهِ لَقَدْ أَدْرَكْتُ سَبْعِينَ بَدْرِيًّا أَكْثَرُ لِبَاسِهِمُ الصُّوفُ وَلَوْ رَأَيْتُمُوهُمْ قُلْتُمْ: مَجَانِينُ، وَلَوْ رَأَوْا خِيَارَكُمْ لَقَالُوا: مَا لِهَؤُلَاءِ مِنْ خَلَاقٍ، وَلَوْ رَأَوْا شِرَارَكُمْ لَقَالُوا: مَا يُؤْمِنُ هَؤُلَاءِ بِيَوْمِ الْحِسَابِ،

Al-Buhuti said:

“*It is recommended not to marry more than one wife if he can maintain chastity with just her, because it entails exposure to the forbidden. Allah said, ﴾**You will never be able to be equitably just between wives, even if you ardently desire such**﴿ [an-Nisa’, 129]. The Prophet ﷺ said, ‘Whoever has two wives and inclines toward one of them will come on the Day of Resurrection with his side inclining’; this was narrated by the Five.*”

Bhai, I came across a narration many years ago in a video. I don't have the actual text but I remember the content. 

It says like when ʿAlī stands between Abū Bakr and ʿUmar, it looks like the word لنا. Which basically means, ʿAlī was shorter than them both. رضي الله عنهم أجمعين. 

Can you please find any narration to support this?

So I guess @⁨Muzammil New⁩ will have to do the effort
17/05/2025, 5:41 pm - +92 316 4986376: Brothers, remember that a weak chain (ḍa‘īf) on a specific quote does not automatically invalidate its meaning—its ruling may still stand if supported by other proofs (ijmā‘, athār, indirect proofs or any other possible tools of istinbat). In this group, our sole task is to verify the authenticity of individual narrations; we do not issue fatāwā and try our best to not delve into fiqh rulings.

Example of it would be the hadith about water's purity which is weak but the unanimous consensus of the scholars affirms its ruling, as Ibn al-Mundhir records: “The scholars unanimously agreed that if impurity falls into water without altering its taste, color, or smell, it remains pure” (Al-Awsat 1/260).

Also the issue about laughing during prayer “The scholars unanimously agreed that laughing when praying invalidates the prayer” (Al-Ijmā‘, p. 3)—and is further supported by maqṭū‘ and mauqūf narrations from Jabir ibn ‘Abdillāh in Sunan ad-Daraqutnī.

I've seen many times he quoted weak narrations and once a fabricated one. I cannot speak on behalf of anyone but we can only have good thoughts إن شاء الله. Most likely he didn't check or he followed another opinion as in this case (shaykh al-Albāni authenticated)

But in this group our concern is whether a quote is authentic or not, if there's ikhtilāf then we look at the correct opinion. We totally respect the scholars who authenticated this and don't force our opinions. <This message was edited>

17/05/2025, 7:24 pm - Muzammil New: *Here we distinguish between proven and unproven quotes/narrations*
*[Males only]*

1) Try to send the quote (Arabic preferably) in text form

2) Try to mention how you want the answer to be beforehand (summarised, takhrīj, scan, voice message etc) to avoid back and forth and wastage of time

3) You are allowed only one question within 24H as checking authenticity takes time

4) Avoid messages that are not related to authenticity. Take them to private 

5) Try to consolidate your question in one single message, be clear and unambiguous 

6) Try to search (and mention) the reference beforehand (if possible) to reduce workload on the answerer. Please do not ask about quotes generated by AI

7) Wait for the answer instead of tagging/reminders as they will not give a quicker reply

*Note:* There can be a difference of opinion on the grading but I won't necessarily mention it.

19/05/2025, 6:33 pm - Muzammil New: No Ḥadīth is authentic from the prophet ﷺ regarding wiping the face after Du'ā but it's proven from the salaf and we don't see rebukement upon them therefore it is permissible 

Abu Nu'aym (Wahb bin Kaysān) said:
*I saw Ibn 'Umar and Ibn al-Zubayr making Du'ā passing their hands upon their faces* _[al-Adab al-Mufrad 609; Isnād Ṣaḥīḥ according to the conditions of al-Bukhārī]_

al-Mu'tamar bin Sulaymān narrated:
*Abu Ka'b (companion of al-Ḥarīr) would raise his hands and when he finished, he would wipe with both the hands on his face. So I told him, who did you see doing this? He said al-Ḥasan bin Abī al-Ḥasan (al-Baṣri)* _[Faḍḍ al-Wi'ā 59; Isnād Ṣaḥīḥ]_

*Ma'mar would raise his hands near his chest during Du'ā and then he would wipe with them both on his face. 'Abd al-Razzāq said: And I would sometimes see him do this and I (also) do it* _[al-Muṣannaf by 'Abd al-Razzāq 3343]_

Muḥammad bin Naṣr said:
*And I saw Isḥāq (bin Rāhūyah) viewing it as something good in acting upon these narrations (of wiping on face)* _[Mukhtaṣar Qiyām al-Layl by Ibn Naṣr p. 327]_

It was narrated that Usamah bin Sharik said:
“I saw the Bedouins asking the Prophet (ﷺ): ‘Is there any harm in such and such, is there any harm in such and such?’ He said to them: ‘O slaves of Allah! Allah has only made harm in that which transgresses the honor of one’s brother. That is what is sinful.’ They said: ‘O Messenger of Allah! Is there any sin if we do not seek treatment?’ He said: ‘Seek treatment, O slaves of Allah! For Allah does not create any disease but He also creates with it the cure, except for old age.’ They said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, what is the best thing that a person may be given?’ He said: ‘Good manners.’”

21/05/2025, 11:06 am - محمد عبد الوهاب: قال الإمام احمد: إذا سألتم الله حفظ القران فسألوه حفظه في عافية فاني كنت حافظا له ورجوت ان احفظه بعد ان اخذ الحديث مأخذه، ولم اقل: عافية. فلم يقدر لي ذلك الا في ايام المحنة.

يعني: فتنة خلق القران

Imām Ahmad (rahimahullah) said:

"If you ask Allah for the memorization of the Qur'an, then ask Him to grant you its memorization with well-being (‘āfiyah). For I was a memorizer of it, and I hoped to retain it after I turned to Hadith — but I did not say: 'With well-being.' So it was not decreed for me except during the days of the trial."

He meant: the trial of the 'Creation of the Qur'an' (fitnat khalq al-Qur’an).

Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah said:

“Whoever commits a sin in private between him and Allah, then admits his sin to his Lord, humbles himself in his heart, asks Him for forgiveness, and repents to Him — then indeed, He is Forgiving, Merciful, Accepting of repentance.

And if the sin was committed openly, he should repent openly.

And if he displays goodness while hiding something evil, he must repent inwardly from the evil.

So whoever does wrong in private, should do good in private; and whoever does wrong in public, should do good in public. As Allah said:
{Indeed, good deeds erase bad deeds. That is a reminder for those who remember.}”

He himself said in al-Madhkal ilā al-Ṣaḥīḥ (97) that "'Abdur Raḥmān bin Zayd bin Aslam narrated fabricated aḥādīth from his father. This cannot be hidden from anyone who ponders amongst the experts of this field (Muḥaddithūn) that the fault is from him"

al-Dhahabī said in al-Talkhīṣ (454): Rather it is fabricated 

al-Bayhaqī said in Dalāil al-Nubuwwah (5/489) that "only  'Abdur Raḥmān bin Zayd bin Aslam narrated it and he's weak"

Ibn al-Jawzī put this in al-Mauḍū'āt (3/174)

He also said (al-'ilal 2/429): "And there is consensus upon the weakness of 'Abdur Raḥmān bin Zayd bin Aslam"

Ibn Taymiyyah also said in majmū' al-Fatāwā (1/254-255) that this Ḥadīth has been declared munkar (denounced) and then said "'Abdur Raḥmān bin Zayd bin Aslam is weak by consensus, makes a lot of mistakes. Aḥmad bin Ḥanbal, Abū Zur'ah, Abū Ḥātim, Al-Nasāī, al-Dāraquṭnī snd others weakened him"

(حديث مرفوع) حَدَّثَنَا  عَفَّانُ ، حَدَّثَنَا  أَبُو عَوَانَةَ ، حَدَّثَنَا  يَزِيدُ بْنُ أَبِي زِيَادٍ ، عَنْ  مُجَاهِدٍ ، عَنِ  ابْنِ عُمَرَ ، عَنِ النَّبِيِّ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ قَالَ:" مَا مِنْ أَيَّامٍ أَعْظَمُ عِنْدَ اللَّهِ، وَلَا أَحَبُّ إِلَيْهِ مِنَ الْعَمَلِ فِيهِنَّ، مِنْ هَذِهِ الْأَيَّامِ الْعَشْرِ، فَأَكْثِرُوا فِيهِنَّ مِنَ التَّهْلِيلِ وَالتَّكْبِيرِ وَالتَّحْمِيدِ".

سیدنا ابن عمر رضی اللہ عنہما سے مروی ہے کہ رسول اللہ  صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم  نے ارشاد فرمایا: ”عشرہ ذی الحجہ سے بڑھ کر کوئی دن اللہ کی نگاہوں میں معظم نہیں اور نہ ہی ان کے علاوہ کسی اور دن میں اعمال اتنے زیادہ پسند ہیں اس لئے ان دونوں میں تہلیل و تکبیر اور تحمید کی کثرت کیا کرو۔“

Abu al-Dardā' (may Allah be pleased with him) used to say: *Learn silence just as you learn speech, for indeed silence is a profound wisdom. Be more eager to listen than you are to speak. Do not speak in that which does not concern you, do not be one who laughs without reason, nor one who walks without a need.*

_[Makārim al-Akhlāq by al-Kharā‘iṭī 397; ṣaḥīḥ isnad]_

أبو الدرداء كان يقول: *تعلموا الصمت كما تتعلمون الكلام، فإن الصمت حكم عظيم، وكن إلى أن تسمع أحرص منك إلى أن تتكلم، ولا تتكلم في شيء لا يعنيك، ولا تكن مضحاكا من غير عجب، ولا مشاء إلى غير أرب يعني إلى غير حاجة*

24/05/2025, 6:49 pm - Mohamed Ahmed Abdulwahab: No Ḥadīth is authentic from the prophet ﷺ regarding wiping the face after Du'ā but it's proven from the salaf and we don't see rebukement upon them therefore it is permissible 

Abu Nu'aym (Wahb bin Kaysān) said:
*I saw Ibn 'Umar and Ibn al-Zubayr making Du'ā passing their hands upon their faces* _[al-Adab al-Mufrad 609; Isnād Ṣaḥīḥ according to the conditions of al-Bukhārī]_

al-Mu'tamar bin Sulaymān narrated:
*Abu Ka'b (companion of al-Ḥarīr) would raise his hands and when he finished, he would wipe with both the hands on his face. So I told him, who did you see doing this? He said al-Ḥasan bin Abī al-Ḥasan (al-Baṣri)* _[Faḍḍ al-Wi'ā 59; Isnād Ṣaḥīḥ]_

*Ma'mar would raise his hands near his chest during Du'ā and then he would wipe with them both on his face. 'Abd al-Razzāq said: And I would sometimes see him do this and I (also) do it* _[al-Muṣannaf by 'Abd al-Razzāq 3343]_

Muḥammad bin Naṣr said:
*And I saw Isḥāq (bin Rāhūyah) viewing it as something good in acting upon these narrations (of wiping on face)* _[Mukhtaṣar Qiyām al-Layl by Ibn Naṣr p. 327]_
24/05/2025, 6:50 pm - +91 77803 61125: yes but it is permissible right? as our prophet Muhammad ﷺ commanded us to follow his companions.
and if we follow the amal of salaf we see that salaf said it is permissible to wipe the face after dua.
so we can follow it.

It has been narrated on the authority of 'Auf b. Malik that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:

The best of your rulers are those whom you love and who love you, who invoke God's blessings upon you and you invoke His blessings upon them. And the worst of your rulers are those whom you hate and who hate you and whom you curse and who curse you. It was asked (by those present): Shouldn't we overthrow them with the help of the sword? He said: No, as long as they establish prayer among you. If you then find anything detestable in them. You should hate their administration, but do not withdraw yourselves from their obedience.

26/05/2025, 1:53 pm - +92 334 3839983: The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) advised:

"If you hear the barking of dogs or the braying of donkeys at night, seek refuge in Allah, for they see what you do not."

Therefore, upon hearing dogs bark at night, it's recommended to say: "A'udhu billahi min ash-shaytan ir-rajim"

This means, "I seek refuge with Allah from Satan, the accursed."

This practice is a form of seeking protection from any potential harm from unseen forces

26/05/2025, 7:36 pm - +91 63887 26284: The Reason Al-Shafi' Refuted Imam Malik: The People's Excessiveness Toward Malik

Al-Bayhaqi said:

I read in the book of Abu Yahya Zakariya ibn Yahya Al-Saji, in what the Egyptians narrated: That Al-Shafi'i only authored his refutation against Malik because it reached him that in Al-Andalus, there was a hat (qalansuwa) attributed to Malik and they would seek rain through it (i.e., treat it as a relic for seeking barakah).

And it was said to them: "The Messenger of Allah said..." - and they would respond: "Malik said..."

So Al-Shafi'i said:

"Malik is a human being; he may err and make mistakes."

What prompted him to write that book (against Malik's positions) was this reason.

He used to say: "I disliked doing this, but I sought guidance from Allah in this matter for such-and-such year." Narrated by Al-Saji

Abū Hurayrah and Ibn ʿUmar may Allah be pleased with both used to go out during the (first) ten days (of Dhul-Ḥijjah) to the marketplace and they would (both) say Takbīr and the people thereafter would say the Takbīr with them. They would not come to the marketplace except for that (purpose).

We said: "O Messenger of Allāh, make for us a Dhāt Anwāṭ like they have a Dhāt Anwāṭ." The Messenger of Allāh ﷺ said: "Allāhu Akbar! Indeed, these are the ways (of those who came before). This is just as the Banū Isrāʾīl said to Mūsā: {Make for us an object of worship as they have objects of worship.} He said: {Indeed, you are a people who are ignorant.} (Qurʾān 7:138)" Then the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ said: "You will most certainly follow the ways (sunan) of those who came before you."

(أخرجه أبو داود (2437)، والنسائي (2372)، وأحمد (26468) واللفظ له)

Summary of Shu'ayb al-Arna'ut on Hadith 22334 from Musnad Ahmad:
The hadith is weak (ḍa‘īf) due to contradictory narrations (iḍṭirāb).

It’s reported with different chains:

From Hunaydah directly.
From his mother from Umm Salamah.
From Hafsah bint ‘Umar.
From one of the Mothers of the Believers, unnamed.
From al-Ḥurr ibn al-Ṣayyāḥ from Ibn ‘Umar.

Due to this inconsistency, al-Zayla‘i considered it weak. (Naṣb al-Rāyah 2/157)
Sharīk, one of the narrators, is known for poor memory, further weakening one of the chains.
An authentic narration from ‘Ā’ishah in Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim contradicts it: She said the Prophet ﷺ never fasted the ten days of Dhul-Hijjah.
A narration from Abū Hurayrah about fasting during these days being equal to a year is also weak, due to unreliable narrators.

29/05/2025, 9:18 am - محمد عبد الوهاب: al-Shāfiʿī said: “The most unjust of the unjust to himself:
سمعت الشافعي يقول: أظلم الظالمين لنفسه

He who humbles himself to those who do not honour him,
من تواضع لمن لا يكرمه،

Seeks the affection of those who do not benefit him,
ورغب في مودّة من لا ينفعه،

Accepts praise from those who do not know him.”
وقبل مدح من لا يعرفه.
