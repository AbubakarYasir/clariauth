Akhi 

حَدَّثَنَا قُتَيْبَةُ بْنُ سَعِيدٍ،حَدَّثَنَا عَبْدُ الْعَزِيزِ بْنُ مُحَمَّدٍ،قَالَ: قَدِمَ عَبَّادُ بْنُ كَثِيرٍ الْمَدِينَةَ،فَمَالَ إِلَی مَجْلِسِ الْعَلَاءِ،فَأَخَذَ بِيَدِہِ فَأَقَامَہُ،ثُمَّ قَالَ: اللہُمَّ إِنَّ ہَذَا يُحَدِّثُ،عَنْ أَبِيہِ،عَنْ أَبِي ہُرَيْرَةَ،أَنَّ رَسُولَ اللہِ ﷺ قَالَ: إِذَا انْتَصَفَ شَعْبَانُ, فَلَا تَصُومُوا. فَقَالَ الْعَلَاءُ: اللہُمَّ إِنَّ أَبِي حَدَّثَنِي،عَنْ أَبِي ہُرَيْرَةَ،عَنِ النَّبِيِّ ﷺ بِذَلِكَ. قَالَ أَبو دَاود: رَوَاہُ الثَّوْرِيُّ وَشِبْلُ بْنُ الْعَلَاءِ وَأَبُو عُمَيْسٍ وَزُہَيْرُ بْنُ مُحَمَّدٍ عَنِ الْعَلَاءِ. قَالَ أَبو دَاود: وَكَانَ عَبْدُ الرَّحْمَنِ لَا يُحَدِّثُ بِہِ،قُلْتُ لِأَحْمَدَ: لِمَ؟ قَالَ: لِأَنَّہُ كَانَ عِنْدَہُ: أَنَّ النَّبِيَّ ﷺ كَانَ يَصِلُ شَعْبَانَ بِرَمَضَانَ،وَقَالَ: عَنِ النَّبِيِّ ﷺ خِلَافَہُ. قَالَ أَبو دَاود: وَلَيْسَ ہَذَا عِنْدِي خِلَافُہُ،وَلَمْ يَجِئْ بِہِ غَيْرُ الْعَلَاءِ،عَنْ أَبِيہِ.


قال الحافظ: وَقَالَ جُمْهُورُ الْعُلَمَاءِ: يَجُوزُ الصَّوْمُ تَطَوُّعًا بَعْدَ النِّصْفِ مِنْ شَعْبَانَ وَضَعَّفُوا الْحَدِيثَ الْوَارِدَ فِيهِ, وَقَالَ أَحْمَدُ وَابْنُ مَعِينٍ إِنَّهُ مُنْكَرٌ اهـ من فتح الباري. وممن ضعفه كذلك البيهقي والطحاوي.

وذكر ابن قدامة في المغني أن الإمام أحمد قال عن هذا الحديث:

(لَيْسَ هُوَ بِمَحْفُوظٍ. وَسَأَلْنَا عَنْهُ عَبْدَ الرَّحْمَنِ بْنَ مَهْدِيٍّ , فَلَمْ يُصَحِّحْهُ , وَلَمْ يُحَدِّثْنِي بِهِ , وَكَانَ يَتَوَقَّاهُ. قَالَ أَحْمَدُ: وَالْعَلاءُ ثِقَةٌ لا يُنْكَرُ مِنْ حَدِيثِهِ إلا هَذَا)

Sahih Muslim 2882 a
Harith b Abi Rabi'a and 'Abdullah b. Safwan both went to Umm Salama, the Mother of the Faithful, and they asked her about the army which would be sunk in the earth, and this relates to the time when Ibn Zubair (was the governor of Mecca). She reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had said that a seeker of refuge would seek refuge in the Sacred House and an army would be sent to him (in order to kill him) and when it would enter a plain ground, it would be made to sink. I said:

Allah's Messenger, what about him who would be made to accompany this army willy nilly? Thereupon he said: He would be made to sink along with them but he would be raised on the Day of Resurrection on the basis of his intention. Abu Ja'far said. ' This plain, ground means the plain ground of Medina.

“And if you ask about the Day of Increase (in reward) and the visit of the all-Mighty, all-Wise, and the sight of His Face - free from any resemblance or likeness to anything - Just as you see the sun at its Zenith in the middle of the day and the full Moon on a cloudless night. A narration traced back to the truthful Prophet, as is present in the sahih books of hadith. From the narration of Jarir and Soahib and Anas and Abu Hurayrah and Abu Musa and Abu Saeed.

So listen on the day that the caller will call: ‘O People of Paradise! Your Lord - Blessed and Exalted - requests you to visit Him, so come to visit Him!’ So they will say: 'We hear and obey!’

Until, when they finally reach the wide valley where they will all meet - and none of them will turn down the request of the caller - the Lord - Blessed and Exalted - will order His Chair to be brought there. Then, pulpits of light will emerge, as well as pulpits of pearls, gemstone, gold, and silver. The lowest of them in rank will sit on sheets of musk, and will not see what those who are on the chairs above them are given. When they are comfortable where they are sitting and are secure in their places, and the caller calls: 'O People of Paradise! You have an appointment with Allaah in which He wishes to reward you!’ So they will say: 'And what is that reward? Has He not already made our faces bright, made our scales heavy, entered us into Paradise, and pushed us away from the Fire?’

And when they are like that, all of a sudden a light shines that encompasses all of Paradise. So, they raise their heads, and, behold: the Compeller - Exalted is He, and Holy are His Names - has come to them from above them and majestified them and said: 'O People of Paradise! Peace be upon you!’ So, this greeting will not be responded to with anything better than: 'O Allaah! You are Peace, and from You is Peace! Blessed are You, O possessor of Majesty and Honor!’ So the Lord - Blessed and Exalted - will laugh to them and say: 'O People of Paradise! Where are those who used to obey Me without having ever seen Me? This is the Day of Increase!’

So, they will all give the same response: 'We are pleased, so be pleased with us!’ So, He will say: 'O People of Paradise! If I were not pleased with you, I would not have made you inhabitants of My Paradise! So, ask of Me!’ So, they will all give the same response: 'Show us your Face so that we may look at it!’ So, the Lord - Mighty and Majestic - will remove his covering and will majestify them and will cover them with His Light, which, if Allaah - the Exalted - had not Willed not to burn them, would have burned them.

And there will not remain a single person in this gathering except that his Lord - the Exalted - will speak to him and say: 'Do you remember the day that you did this and that?’ and He will remind him of some of his bad deeds in the Worldy life, so he will say: 'O Lord! Will you not forgive me?’ So, He will say: 'Of course! You have not reached this position of yours (in Paradise) except by my forgiveness.’”

From the Arabic book: Haadi al-Arwaah ilaa Bilaad il-Afraah by Ibn al-Qayyim, p.355-360.

Found this:

حدثنا أبو بكرة، قال: ثنا أبو داود ووهب قالا: ثنا شعبة، عن سلمة بن كهيل، عن أبي ظبيان أنه رأى عليا ﵁ بال، قائما، ثم دعا بماء، فتوضأ ومسح على نعليه، ثم دخل المسجد، فخلع نعليه ثم صلى

I seek forgiveness from Allāh the Mighty, Whom there is none worthy of worship except Him, the Living, the Eternal, and I repent to Him.

will be forgiven even if he run away from the battle.

Akhi,

This is EASIEST Way to Conquer your Nafs.

LIFEHACK: Listen to EXTREME Stories of High Aspiration & Discpline.

"But Akhi! I Listen to David Goggins & it Only Gets me motivated for 5 Mins MAXX!"

Ever Heard of Al-Baraa ibn Malik?

He was so Thin & Wiry it was Painful to LOOK at him!

When Muslims were Near Defeat against Army of Musaylamah.

Khalid turned to al-Baraa and said, "Charge, young man of the Ansar."

Al-Baraa turned to his men and said, "O Ansar, let NOT anyone of you THINK of returning to Madinah. There is NO MADINAH for you after this day. There is ONLY Allah, then Paradise."

He and the Ansar then Launched their Attack against the Mushrikeen, until they began to Withdraw!

And when Musaylamah and his men entered and closed the gates behind them.

He said: PUT ME ON A SHIELD. Raise the shield on spears and hurl me into the garden near the gate. Either I shall die a martyr or I shall open the gate for you."

he was Thrown into the Garden of Death amongst the multitude of Musaylamah's men.

He Descended on them Like a Thunderbolt and Continued to Fight them in front of the gate.

MANY Fell to his Sword.

he himself sustained 80+ WOUNDS before he could open the Gate!

Finally the Muslims came upon Musaylamah and he was killed.

Akhi,

It's Stories like these.

They Make you Live with those People of High Aspiration.

And make all your Struggles so TINY & Simple Compared to them!

It's Stories Like these that Deserve to be Remembered DAILY.

Because we cant find Examples like these Anymore around us!

And whoever covers (the faults of) a Muslim, Allah will cover (his faults) for him in the world and the Hereafter. And Allah is engaged in helping the worshipper as long as the worshipper is engaged in helping his brother.”

Ad-Daaraqutni narrated with a saheeh isnaad from Ibn al-Mubaarak: al-Mas‘oodi told us, from al-Minhaal ibn ‘Amr, from Abu ‘Ubaydah, from ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ood, who said: “Hasten to Jumu‘ah, for verily Allah will appear to the people of Paradise every Friday when they gather at a sand hill of camphor, and their closeness to Him will be commensurate with the degree to which they hastened to Jumu‘ah in this world.” Then he listed a number of isnaads for it, then he said: 

This that Ibn Mas‘ood told us is something that he could only know from a Prophet or from someone who took it from a Prophet. Thus it is known that Ibn Mas‘ood took it from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and it is not possible for him to have taken it from the People of the Book”

I wanted to know if the phrase “their closeness to Him will be commensurate with the degree to which they hastened to Jumu‘ah in this world” is true and authentic?

Sunan Ibn Majah 3719
It was narrated that Umm Salamah said:
"Abu Bakr went out to trade in Busra, one year before the Prophet (ﷺ) died, and with him were Nu`aiman and Suwaibit the sons of Harmalah, who had been present at Badr. Nu`aiman was in charge of the provisions, and Suwaibit was a man who joked a lot. He said to Nu`aiman: 'Feed me'. He said: 'Not until Abu Bakr comes'. He said: 'Then I will have to annoy you'. Then they passed by some people, and Suwaibit said to them: 'Will you buy a slave from me?' They said: 'Yes'. He said 'He is a slave who talks a lot and he will tell you, "I am a free man". If you are going to let him go when he says that to you, do not bother buying him.' They said: 'We will buy him from you.' So they bought him from him in return for ten young she-camels, then they brought him and tied a turban or a rope around his neck. Nu`aiman said: 'This man is making fun of you. I am a free man, not a slave.' They said: 'He has already told us about you; and they took him off.' Then Abu Bakr came and he (Suwaibit) told him about that. So he followed those people and returned their camels to them, and took Nu`aiman back. When they came to the Prophet (ﷺ) they told him what had happened, and the Prophet (ﷺ) and his companions laughed about it for a year."

06/03/2025, 9:12 pm - +91 79029 79751: My question:-

  

 what's the authenticity of the athar where abu hurayrah said that (something like) may Allah سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَى forgive the one who asks forgiveness for the mother of abu hurayrah رَضِيَ ٱللَّٰهُ عَنْهُ 
 
Also what are the comments of the scholars on this narration? Did anyone from the salaf or from our kibar ulema of the past or present did this ? Basically did anyone preceeded us in doing it? <This message was edited>

See Sahih Muslim 2491

Muhammad Ibn Sīrīn said, "We were with Abu Hurayrah one night and he said, 'O Allah, forgive Abu Hurayrah and his mother and whoever asks for forgiveness for both of them.'" 
Muḥammad said, "We used to ask for forgiveness for them so that we would be included in Abu Hurayrah's Du'ā."

(116)Chapter: What Has Been Related About Not Reciting Behind The Imam When The Imam Is Reciting Aloud


Jami` at-Tirmidhi 312
Abu Hurairah narrated:
"Allah's Messenger turned (after praying) from a Salat in which he recited aloud and said: 'Has any one of you recite along with me just now?' A man said: 'Yes, O Messenger of Allah.' He said: 'Indeed I said to myself: Why was I being contended with for the Quran?'" He (Az-Zuhri one of the narrators) said: "So when they heard that from Allah's Messenger, the people stopped reciting with Allah's Messenger in the prayers that Allah's Messenger recited aloud."

Is this authentic?

Al-Imam Ibn Battah d. 387 )رحمه الله( transmitted the consensus:

"The Muslims, including the Companions and The Followers of The Companions, and all the people of knowledge of the believers, unanimously agree (l.e ljma) that Allah, glorified and exalted, is above His... Throne, distinct from His creation, and His knowledge encompasses all of His creation. None denies this except those who adopt the beliefs of Hulūliyyah. They are people whose hearts have deviated, and they were seduced by the devils, so they strayed from the true religion. They claim that Allah's Essence is not separate from any place, asserting that He is on the Earth as He is in the heavens, and His essence exists within everything. The Qur'an, the Sunnah, and the statements of the Companions and The Followers of the Companions among the Muslim scholars have refuted their claims."

09/03/2025, 4:37 pm - +91 97913 71056: Bad breath during Fasting:

Some people mistakenly think that the bad breath of the fasting person is a good thing, citing the Hadith: 

وَلَخَلُوفُ فَمِ الصَّائِمِ أَطْيَبُ عِنْدَ اللَّهِ مِنْ رِيحِ الْمِسْكِ
"The smell of the mouth of a fasting person is better in the sight of God than the smell of musk (perfume)." 
["Sahih Bukhari", 5927].
https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5927

This is a wrong understanding of the Hadith.

It is talking about the odour that is generated by the empty stomach, it is not encouraging a lack of hygiene by not brushing your teeth. 

This misunderstanding arose at the time of Mu'adh Ibn Jabbal, and he corrected it: 

روى الطبراني في " الكبير " ( 20 / 70 / 133 ) ، وفي " مسند الشاميين " ( 2250 ) بإسناد يحتمل التحسين عن عبد الرحمن بن غنم قال : "سألت معاذ بن جبل : أأتسوك وأنا صائم ؟ قال : نعم . قال : أي النهار أتسوك ؟ قال : أي النهار شئت غدوة أو عشية . قلت : إن الناس يكرهونه عشية ، ويقولون : إن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قال : لخلوف الصائم أطيب عند الله من ريح المسك ؟ فقال : سبحان الله ! لقد أمرهم بالسواك ، وهو يعلم أنه لا بد أن يكون بفي الصائم خلوف وإن استاك ، وما كان بالذي يأمرهم أن ينتنوا أفواههم عمداً ، ما في ذلك من الخير شيء ، بل فيه شر ، إلا من ابتلي ببلاء لا يجد منه بداً . قلت : والغبار في سبيل الله أيضاً كذلك ؛ إنما يؤجر من اضطر إليه ، ولا يجد عنه محيصاً ؟ قال : نعم ، فأما من ألقى نفسه في البلاء عمداً ، فما له في ذلك من أجر " .
وقال الحافظ في " التلخيص " ( ص 193 ) : " إسناده جيد " .
A man said to the companion of the Prophet, Mu’aadh ibn Jabal: "𝗣𝗲𝗼𝗽𝗹𝗲 𝗱𝗶𝘀𝗹𝗶𝗸𝗲 (𝗯𝗿𝘂𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗲𝗲𝘁𝗵) 𝗶𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘆 𝘀𝗮𝘆 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗽𝗵𝗲𝘁 ﷺ 𝘀𝗮𝗶𝗱: 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗯𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗵 𝗼𝗳 𝗮 𝗳𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗽𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗼𝗻 𝗶𝘀 𝗯𝗲𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗶𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝗼𝗳 𝗚𝗼𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝗰𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗼𝗳 𝗺𝘂𝘀𝗸 (𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗳𝘂𝗺𝗲)!"
So Mu'adh said: "𝗦𝘂𝗯𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗔𝗹𝗹𝗮𝗵, 𝗵𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗺 𝘁𝗼 𝗯𝗿𝘂𝘀𝗵 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗶𝗿 𝘁𝗲𝗲𝘁𝗵 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝗶𝘄𝗮𝗮𝗸 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗵𝗲 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝘄𝗶𝗹𝗹 𝗯𝗲 𝗯𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗵 𝗼𝗻 𝗮 𝗳𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗽𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗼𝗻 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗻 𝗶𝗳 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘆 𝘂𝘀𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗼𝗼𝘁𝗵 𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗸! 𝗛𝗲 𝘄𝗮𝘀 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗽𝗲𝗼𝗽𝗹𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗶𝗿 𝗯𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗵 𝗼𝗱𝗼𝗿𝗼𝘂𝘀 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆! 𝗧𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝗻𝗼 𝗴𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗶𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁, 𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗿 𝗶𝘁 𝗶𝘀 𝗯𝗮𝗱, except for the one who is tested and tried and can’t find any escape."
["Tabarani", 20/133 - Ibn Hajar said the chain is good: إسناده جيد ].

--------------------------------

The Prophet used to brush his teeth, when he was fasting. It is encouraged to brush the teeth during fasting even if its with toothpaste, as long as its not swallowed - according to many scholars.

This is especially important when you meet other people, attend gatherings and meetings, etc.

yes da'if, isnad has two weak narrators and I wrote a detailed takhrij for this long back. Perhaps you have it

(And to say shaykh al-Albani رحمه الله said it's Hasan then it seems doubtful as the books which were not published in his time, he would follow al-Suyuti's grading and put a question mark in sahih al-Jami' as one of his students said. So it seems that the same thing happened here)

1. Al-Fiqh al-Akbar is not proven from Abū Ḥanīfah 
2. I don't know the Arabic for this but how is this proof for the innovated tawassul?
3. Ḍa'īf, Isnād has unknown narrators
4. Same answer as 2.

Calling upon other than Allah is shirk Akbar 

[Fātir - 14] If you invoke them, they hear not your call, and if they were to hear, they could not grant it (your request) to you. And on the Day of Resurrection, they will disown your Shirk with them.

My forelock is in Your hand, Your decision over me has passed, and Your decree upon me is in justice. I ask You by every name with which You have named Yourself, or revealed in Your Book, or taught to one of Your creatures, or kept hidden in the Unseen with You, that You make the Quran the spring of my heart, the light within me, the banisher of my depression, and the expeller of my anxiety,’ then Allah will expel his worry and replace his grief with joy.” It was said, “O Messenger of Allah, shall we not study these words?” The Prophet said, “Of course, whoever hears them should study them.”

السلام عليكم ورحمة الله وبركاته 

Akhi, there is a hadith, but I don't exactly remember the matn. It says something like all the prophets made their dua, but the dua of prophet ﷺ is not yet made. And the reason was that he ﷺ kept it on the Day of Judgment to utilize that dua for the ummah.

is there any such hadith? What's its authenticity?

Could you give the takhrij ?

Abu’l-Jawza’ Aws ibn ‘Abd-Allaah who said: The people of Madeenah were faced with a severe drought. They complained to ‘Aa'ishah who said: “Look at the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and make an opening facing the sky so that there will be no barrier between him and the sky.” They did that, then it rained until the plants grew and the camels grew exceedingly fat, and it was called the year of the exceedingly fat animals.

*O my son, when you have written down ten Ahaadeeth, look and see if you notice an improvement in the way you walk, in your level of patience, and in your degree of self-dignity.*

For if you do not see any such improvement, then know that your *knowledge harms* you and does not benefit you.'"

2) Try to mention how you want the answer to be beforehand (summarised, takhrīj, scan, voice message etc) to avoid back and forth and wastage of time

3) You are allowed only one question a day as checking authenticity takes time

4) Avoid discussions that are not related to authenticity. Take them to private

5) Try to consolidate your question in one single message, be clear and unambiguous 

6) Only admins are allowed to answer

7) Wait for the answer as tagging/reminders will not give a faster reply

Sheikh Ul Islam Ibn Tammiyah رَحِمَهُ ٱللَّٰهُ
The part صدر  use as near chest not the hard part 
And also 
Imam Ibn Qudama رَحِمَهُ ٱللَّٰهُ & Imam Nawawi رَحِمَهُ ٱللَّٰهُ 
Use the Hadith of 
" Chest" as "Above the navel"
So this shows that 
The scholars Took the meaning of chest as above the navel IN SHA ALLAH I'll send all the references 
Words like 
Above the Navel 
Under the chest 
All comes under this 
Just remember this u shouldn't place them upper part of the chest 
But below the chest the stomach area also include in صدر
14/03/2025, 11:08 pm - Abdullah PFP design Mustafa: Becz if u say a layman that place on chest he probably place them on hard part 
What mean by sadr is above the navel area said by scholars والله أعلم

Imam Ibn Qudama رَحِمَهُ ٱللَّٰهُ
14/03/2025, 11:18 pm - Abdullah PFP design Mustafa: And Above the Navel under the chest  is Proven from 
Many of The salaf like 
Ali رضى الله عنه 
Sa'id b. Jubair رَحِمَهُ ٱللَّٰهُ
Imam Shafi'i رَحِمَهُ ٱللَّٰهُ 
Imam Ahmad رَحِمَهُ ٱللَّٰهُ 
And many more
14/03/2025, 11:22 pm - Abdullah PFP design Mustafa: And understand what Imam Ahmad رَحِمَهُ ٱللَّٰهُ Said Makruh 
Is on near the Chest and himself he  place above the navel 
So it is understood that what he meant by makruh is the upper part not the stomach area 
And what is meant by placing on sadr is 
Above the navel stomach area and u will see ita more natural then that hard part and and below the navel i only know from some salaf like Abu Mijlaz , Sufiyan Thawri some scholar mentioned  and 
Imam ishaq bin Rahwayh and one rivyat from Imam Ahmad 
But it's not proven from Nabi ﷺ or sahaba with authentic isnad 
Becz of amal of salaf it's jaiz but 
Afazl sunnah is 
Above the navel area 
والله أعلم

He did not come to any verse that spoke of punishment but he paused and sought refuge with Allah.  Then he bowed for as long as he had stood, saying whilst bowing: “Subhaana dhi’l-jabarooti wa’l-malakooti wa’l-kibriya’ wa’l-‘azamah (Glory be to the One Who has all power, dominion, magnificence and might).” Then he prostrated for as long as he had stood, and he said something similar when prostrating, then he stood and recited Aal ‘Imraan, then he recited soorah by soorah.

17/03/2025, 4:23 pm - Muzammil New: *Here we distinguish between proven and unproven quotes/narrations*
*[Males only]*

1) Try to send the quote (Arabic preferably) in text form

2) Try to mention how you want the answer to be beforehand (summarised, takhrīj, scan, voice message etc) to avoid back and forth and wastage of time

3) You are allowed only one question within 24H as checking authenticity takes time

4) Avoid messages that are not related to authenticity. Take them to private 

5) Try to consolidate your question in one single message, be clear and unambiguous 

6) Only admins are allowed to answer

7) Wait for the answer instead of tagging/reminders as they will not give a quicker reply

*Note:* There can be a difference of opinion on the grading but I won't necessarily mention it.
Corrections are welcome privately

The Best Type of Worship

Wakīʿ ibn al-Jarrāh‌ stated that he heard Sufyān al-Thawrī رحمهما الله say: 

"I do not know of any form of worship better than the people learning knowledge."

18/03/2025, 4:29 pm - Muzammil New: Sufyān al-Thawri said:
*“I do not know an act of worship better than teaching the people knowledge”*
[al-Madkhal by al-Bayhaqī 471 with Ḥasan Isnād]

al-Shāfi'ī said
*“Seeking knowledge is better than voluntary prayers”*
[al-Madkhal by al-Bayhaqī 474 with Ṣaḥīḥ Isnād]

Ibn al-Mubārak said:
*“I never saw a person noble like Mālik bin Anas even though he didn't have a lot of prayer or fasting except that he had secret (good deeds)”*
[Ḥilyat al-Awliyā; Ḥasan Isnād]

al-Dhahabī commented:
*“What he had from knowledge and spreading it was better than voluntary fasting and praying for whom intends by it (pleasure of) Allah”*
[Siyar a'lām al-Nubalā 8/97]

Ishāq al-Kawsaj said:
*I asked Aḥmad regarding the one who says ‘revising knowledge part of the night is more beloved to me than staying awake (and praying)’. He said “(It means) the knowledge which the people benefit thereby in their religion.” I asked: Wuḍū, Ṣalāh, Ṣawm, Ḥajj, Ṭalāq and so on? He said: “Yes.” Ishāq (bin Rāhūyah) said: It is as he said*

19/03/2025, 5:36 pm - +91 79072 95072: حدثنا أبو بكر النيسابوري ثنا أبو الأزهر ثنا عبد الرزاق ثنا أبو جعفر الرازي عن الربيع بن أنس عن أنس بن مالك قال ما زال رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم يقنت في الفجر حتى فارق الدنيا
Abu Ja’far Ar-Rāzī from Ar-Rabi’ ibn Anas From Anas ibn Mālik (radiya Allahu ‘anhu), “Rasulullah (sallallahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) never ceased making Qunut in Fajr until he left the world.”

In another wording via a different chain up to Abu Ja’far Ar-Rāzī:

حدثنا أحمد بن إسحاق بن بهلول ثنا أبي ثنا عبيد الله بن موسى ح وحدثنا أبو بكر النيسابوري ثنا أحمد بن يوسف السلمي ثنا عبيد الله بن موسى ثنا أبو جعفر الرازي عن الربيع بن أنس عن أنس أن النبي صلى الله عليه و سلم قنت شهرا يدعوا عليهم ثم تركه وأما في الصبح فلم يزل يقنت حتى فارق الدنيا لفظ النيسابوري
From Anas ibn Mālik who said that the Nabi made qunut one month, supplicating against them (i.e. the enemies), then he left that, but as for in the morning prayer, he never ceased performing [the qunut] until he left the earth. [Daraqutni comments: “This is the wording of (Abu Bakr) An-Naysaburī”]

In another narration from Ar-Rabi’ ibn Anas he says:

حدثنا الحسين بن إسماعيل ثنا أحمد بن منصور وأحمد بن محمد بن عيسى قالا ثنا أبو نعيم ثنا أبو جعفر الرازي عن الربيع بن أنس قال كنت جالسا عند أنس بن مالك فقيل له إنما قنت رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم شهرا فقال ما زال رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم يقنت في صلاة الغداة حتى فارق الدنيا
“We were sitting with Anas [ibn Mālik] and it was said to him that Rasulullah (sa) only performed qunut for one month [then ceased]. So he said, ‘Rasulullah (sa) never ceased performing qunut in the Morning Prayer until he left this world.’”

This narration is recorded by Imam Ahmad in his Musnad and Al-Haythami commented, “Its men are trustworthy.”3 Abdur-Razzāq in his Musannaf4, Hilyat Al-Awliya’ 9/57, Al-Bayhaqi in his Al-Kubra, Al-Hākim in his Mustadarak who said, “It is Sahih upon the conditions of Al-Bukhārī and he did not report it with this wording.” Adh-Dhahabi agreed. Al-Hafidh Ibn Hajr Al-’Asqalani stated in Nata‘ij Al-Afkar fi Takhrij Ahadith Al-Adhkar, “This hadith is Hasan, it was reported by Ahmad from Abdur-Razzaq from Abu Ja’far Ar-Razi.”((Vol. 2 page 94, Dar Al Kutub Al-’Ilmiyyah )) Imam an-Nawawi says about his hadith in his Majmu’,

“This hadith is Sahih (rigorously authentic) and it was reported by a group of the masters of hadith whom declared it Sahih. From those who declared this hadith authentic were Al-Hafith Abu Abdullah Muhammad ibn ‘Ali Al-Balkhi and Al-Hakim Abu Abdullah in several places throughout his works, as well as Imam Al-Bayhaqi, and it is reported by Ad-Daraqutni through [many] ways that are Sahih.” [Vol. 3 page 484]

20/03/2025, 4:34 pm - Mohamed Ahmed Abdulwahab: Is this authentic? Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Laylat al-Qadr is a pleasant night, neither hot nor cold, and the following day the sun rises red and weak.” (Saheeh Ibn Khuzaymah, 2912; Musnad al-Tayaalisi).
20/03/2025, 4:57 pm - Muzammil New: وعليكم السلام ورحمة الله وبركاته
the night being neither hot nor cold as a sign of laylat al-Qadr is not authentic

So we should follow the sunnah of striving all the ten nights as the prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم did

Note: the date for laylat al-Qadr changes every year

Remember that checking authenticity takes time as we have to collect the chains and check narrators and statements of scholars 

But given that we're in the last ten nights, we should focus on worshipping Allah 

عن عائشة رضي الله عنها قالت‏:‏ كان رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم إذا دخل العشر أحيا الليل وأيقظ أهله، وشد المئزر‏‏
‏متفق عليه‏
'Āishah رضي الله عنها reported:
When the last ten nights would begin, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) would keep awake at night, awaken his family and prepare himself to be more diligent in worship.
وعنها قالت‏:‏ كان رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم ، يجتهد في رمضان ما لا يجتهد في غيره، وفي العشر الأواخر منه، ما لا يجتهد في غيره‏"‏ 
‏رواه مسلم‏
And she reported:
The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to strive more in worship during Ramadan than he strove in any other time of the year; and he would devote himself more in the last ten nights of Ramadan than he strove in earlier part of the month.

22/03/2025, 11:05 pm - Muzammil New: قال تعالى:
يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا تُوبُوا إِلَى اللَّهِ تَوْبَةً نَصُوحًا [التحريم ٨]
“O you who believe! Turn to Allah with sincere repentance”
”اے ایمان والو! تم اللہ کے آگے توبہ کرو خالص توبہ“ 

أخرج ابن أبي شيبة والطبري بأسانيد حسان من طريق أبي الأحوص عن سماك عن النعمان بن بشير قال: سئل عمر عن التوبة النصوح، فقال: *التوبة النصوح أن يتوب العبد من العمل السيء ثم لا يعود إليه أبدا*
'Umar رضي الله عنه was asked about the sincere repentance (al-Tawbah al-Naṣūḥ) so he said: *Sincere repentance is when a servant repents from a bad deed and then never returns to it again.*
عمر رضی اللہ عنہ سے سچی توبہ (التوبہ النصوح) کے بارے میں پوچھا گیا تو آپ نے فرمایا: *سچی توبہ وہ ہے جب بندہ کسی گناہ سے توبہ کرے اور پھر اس کی طرف واپس نہ آئے*

قال ابن أبي حاتم :
حدثنا أبي ، حدثنا عمرو بن علي ، حدثنا عباد بن عمرو ، حدثنا أبو عمرو بن العلاء سمعت الحسن يقول : التوبة النصوح : *أن تبغض الذنب كما أحببته ، وتستغفر منه إذا ذكرته*
قلت: إسناده صحيح 
al-Ḥasan al-Baṣrī says: *Sincere repentance is to hate the sin as you loved it, and to seek forgiveness when you remember it.*
الحسن البصری رحمہ اللہ کہتے ہیں: سچی توبہ: *گناہ سے نفرت کرنا جیسا کہ تم اسے پسند کرتے ہو،*
*اور استغفار کرنا جب اسے یاد کرتے ہو*

23/03/2025, 11:08 pm - Muzammil New: رسول ﷺ نے فرمایا: *”شب قدر چوبیسویں رات ہے“* [الطیالسی ۲۲۸۱ وسندہ حسن]

پتہ چلا کہ شب قدر ممکن ہے جفت والی راتوں میں ہو، البتہ طاق راتوں میں زیادہ امکانات ہیں، اس کی دلیل یہ ہے کہ نبی ﷺ نے فرمایا: *"اسے تلاش کرو جب نو رات باقی رہ جائیں، یا سات رہ جائیں، یا پانچ رہ جائیں یا تین ره جائیں یا پھر آخری رات ہوجائے"* [الترمذی ۷۹۴ وسندہ صحیح]

 ابن تیمیہ نے کہا: *”اس بنا پر، اگر مہینہ تیس ہے تو وہ راتیں جفت ہیں“*
 مزید فرمایا: *"جب صورت حال ایسا ہے تو مومن کو چاہیے کہ وہ آخری عشرہ  مکمل (تمام رتیں) میں (لیلۃ القدر ) تلاش کرے"* [مجموع الفتاوی ۲۵/۲۸۴]
اور معلوم ہے کہ رسول اللہ ﷺ نے مکمل آخری عشرہ اعتکاف کیا اور ہر رات محنت کی۔

 ابو قلابہ نے کہا: *”شب قدر تمام دس راتوں میں گردش کرتی ہے“*
[مصنف ابن ابی شیبہ ۹۷۹۰ وسندہ صحیح]

The prophet ﷺ said: *“Laylat al-Qadr is the 24th night”* [al-Ṭayālisī 2281; Ḥasan Isnād]

This shows that Laylat al-Qadr can happen on the even nights, though there's more chances within the odd ones. An evidence is that the prophet ﷺ said: *"Seek it when nine remain or when seven remain or when five remain or when three remain or when it's the last night."* [al-Tirmidhi 794; Sahih Isnad]

Ibn Taymiyyah said: *"Based on this, if the month is thirty days then these nights would be even."* He further added: *"If such is the situation, then it's incumbent that a believer seeks for it in all of the ten nights"* [Majmū' al-Fatāwā 25/284]. And it is well-known that the Prophet saw did i'tikāf and strove all the 10 nights

Abu Qilabah said: *"Laylat al-Qadr revolves in all of the last ten nights"* [Musannaf ibn abi shaybah 9790; Sahih Isnad]

قال الطيالسي(٢٢٨١): *"حدثنا حماد عن الجريري عن أبي نضرة عن أبي سعيد قال: قال رسول الله ﷺ: ليلة القدر ليلة أربع ‌وعشرين"*

قال ابن تيمية في شرح عمدة الفقه (٣/٥٦٣): *"رواه الطيالسي في مسنده بإسناد جيد"*
وقال ابن كثير في تفسيره (١٤/٤١١): *"إسناده رجاله ثقات"*

قلت: هذا إسناد حسن وقد قال ابن حجر في مثل هذا الإسناد: *"واسم ‌الجريري ‌سعيد ‌بن ‌إياس ‌وكان ‌ممن ‌اختلط ‌لكن ‌سماع ‌حماد ‌بن ‌سلمة ‌منه ‌قبل ‌اختلاطه ‌واسم ‌أبي ‌نضرة ‌المنذر ‌بن ‌مالك"* (الأمالي المطلقة ص ٥٧)
وقال ابن معين: *”حماد بن سلمة في أول أمره، وآخر أمره واحد“* (تاريخ الدوري ٤٥٤٥)

وليلة القدر تجوز أن تكون في الليالي الشفعية إلا أن الوتر منها أكثر وقوعاً فمن الأدلة قول النبي: *”التمسوها في تسع يبقين، أو في سبع يبقين، أو في خمس يبقين، أو في ثلاث أَواخر ليلة“* [الترمذي ٧٩٤ وسنده صحيح]

قال ابن تيمية: *”فعلى هذا: إذا كان الشهر ثلاثين يكون ذلك ليالي الأشفاع“*
ثم قال: *”وإذا كان الأمر هكذا فينبغي أن يتحراها المؤمن في العشر الأواخر جميعه“* [مجموع الفتاوى ٢٥/٢٨٤]
ومن المعلوم أن النبي ﷺ اعتكف واجتهد في جميع الليالي

قال ابن أبي شيبة (٩٧٩٠): حدثنا الثقفي عن أيوب عن أبي ‌قلابة قال: *”‌ليلة القدر تجول في ليالي العشر كلها“*

*_He was asked:_ "Is the ḥadīth regarding reciting surat al-Kahf on Friday proven? Please answer with evidences"*

*_Answer:_* The following narration is narrated regarding reciting surat al-Kahf on Friday:
حدَّثنا سعيدٌ، قال: نا هُشيمٌ، أنا أبو هاشمٍ، عن أبي مِجْلَزٍ، عن قيسِ بنِ عُبَادٍ، عن أبي سعيدٍ الخدريِّ؛ قال: ((مَن قَرأ سورةَ الكهفِ يومَ الجُمُعةِ، أضاء له من النُّورِ ما بينه وبينَ البيتِ العَتِيقِ.))
*"Whoever recites surat al-Kahf on Friday, a light will shine between him and the Ka'bah"*
[Sunan Ibn Manṣūr 1368 with Ṣaḥīḥ Isnād cf. al-Dārimī 3450 (with "Friday night"), Faḍāil al-Qur'ān by Abu 'Ubayd p. 244]

The following is a summarised information about the narrators:
(1) *Sa'īd bin Manṣūr:* "Trustworthy author" (al-Taqrīb 2399)
(2) *Hushaym bin Bashīr:* "Trustworthy" (al-Taqrīb 7312)
He is Mudallis too but he clarified that he heard from the next narrator in the aforementioned Sanad
(3) *Abu Hāshim Yaḥyā bin Dīnār al-Wāsiṭī:* "Trustworthy" (al-Taqrīb 8425)
(4) *Abu Mijlaz Lāḥiq bin Ḥumayd:* "Trustworthy" (al-Taqrīb 7490)
(5) *Qays bin 'Ubbād:* "Trustworthy" (al-Taqrīb 5582)

al-Nasā'ī رحمه الله said: *"Mawqūf is correct"* (al-Sunan al-Kubrā 9/37)
al-Bayhaqī رحمه الله said: *"And this is what is preserved, Mawqūf"* (Shu'ab al-Īmān 4/86)
Meaning that according to al-Nasā'ī and al-Bayhaqī the Mawqūf (Attributed to a Ṣaḥābī) is preserved
*Ibn Ḥajar رحمه الله also declared the Mawqūf as being more authentic* (al-Talkhīṣ al-Ḥabīr 2/1765)
cf. al-Dhahabi said: *"Mawqūf is more authentic"* (al-Muhadhab fī ikhtiṣār al-Sunan al-Kabīr 1/42)

Abū Hurayrah (raḍiy Allāhu ʿanhu) narrated that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: “When one of you enters the morning, they should say “I have entered the morning praising You, and I bear witness that there is no god worthy of worship but Allah.” three times. And when they enter the evening, they should say the same.” (Nasā’ī in Sunan al-Kubrā 10331)

عَنْ عَمْرِو بْنِ شُعَيْبٍ، عَنْ أَبِيهِ، عَنْ جَدِّهِ، قَالَ: قَالَ رَسُولُ اللهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم: " مَنْ قَالَ: سُبْحَانَ اللهِ مِائَةَ مَرَّةٍ قَبْلَ طُلُوعِ الشَّمْسِ وَقَبْلَ غُرُوبِهَا كَانَ أَفْضَلَ مِنْ مِائَةِ بَدَنَةٍ، وَمَنْ قَالَ: الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ مِائَةَ مَرَّةٍ قَبْلَ طُلُوعِ الشَّمْسِ، وَقَبْلَ غُرُوبِهَا كَانَ أَفْضَلَ مِنْ مِائَةِ فَرَسٍ يُحْمَلُ عَلَيْهَا، وَمَنْ قَالَ: اللهُ أَكْبَرُ مِائَةَ مَرَّةٍ قَبْلَ طُلُوعِ الشَّمْسِ وَقَبْلَ غُرُوبِهَا، كَانَ أَفْضَلَ مِنْ عِتْقِ مِائَةِ رَقَبَةٍ، وَمَنْ قَالَ: لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللهُ، وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ، لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَلَهُ الْحَمْدُ، وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ مِائَةَ مَرَّةٍ قَبْلَ طُلُوعِ الشَّمْسِ وَقَبْلَ غُرُوبِهَا، لَمْ يَجِئْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ أَحَدٌ بِعَمَلٍ أَفْضَلَ مِنْ عَمَلِهِ إِلَّا مَنْ قَالَ قَوْلَهُ أَوْ زَادَ.(السنن الكبرى للنسائي ١٠٥٨٨)

The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: “Whoever says ‘Subḥānallāh’ 100 times before sunrise and 100 times before sunset, it will be better than 100 camels (which are sacrificed for the sake of Allah). Whoever says ‘Alḥamdullilāh’ 100 times before sunrise and 100 times before sunset, it will be better than 100 horses on which he sends 100 warriors (in the path of Allah). Whoever says ‘Allāhu Akbar’ 100 times before sunrise and 100 times before sunset, it will be better than freeing 100 slaves.” (Nasā’ī: al-Sunan al-Kubrā 10588)

مجموع الفتاوى ج. ٢٨ ص.٢٣١

"It was asked to Ahmad ibn Hanbal: Is it dearer to you that a man fasts, prays and secludes himself (does ‘itikaf), or that he speaks against  the people of innovation?

He said: If he stands and prays and does ‘itikaf, then it is for himself alone, but if he speaks against the people of innovation, then it is for the Muslims. This (the latter) is better."

Ibn Rajab (رحمه الله) commented in Fatḥ al-Bārī (6/67-68):

“This ḥadīth indicates adorning oneself for Eid, and it was customary among them.”

The Forty-Fourth Point: That Allah's pleasure with His servant is greater than Paradise and all that is in it. This is because pleasure (رضا) is an attribute of Allah, whereas Paradise is His creation. Allah, the Exalted, said:

"And the pleasure of Allah is greater." [At-Tawbah: 72]

This statement follows His words:

"Allah has promised the believing men and believing women Gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide eternally, and pleasant dwellings in Gardens of perpetual residence. But the pleasure of Allah is greater. That is the supreme success." [At-Tawbah: 72]

This divine pleasure is a reward for their contentment with Him in this world. And since this reward is the greatest of all rewards, its cause must be the best of all deeds.

Is this authentic
Imam Malik was teaching his class in Masjid An-Nabawi and when he teached a ḥadith, he always mentioned the entire chain of narration.

And one day he saw a boy playing with a straw whilst he was teaching. He continued teaching until the end of the lesson before approaching the young boy.

He asked the boy: “How dare you mess about whilst being taught teachings from our Nabi?”

The boy told Imam Malik that he was not playing with the straw but instead, he was using his saliva to make notes as he did not have have money for pen and paper.

Imam Malik tested the boy and he was able to narrate every single ḥadīth with the chain of narration.

This boy, was Imam Shafi'i. (رحمهم الله)

03/04/2025, 9:23 am - +91 79072 95072: A Duā That Left The Angels Unable To Record It's Reward!

‎عن ابن عمر أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه سلم حدثهم أن عبدا من عبد الله قال: يا رب لك الحمد كما ينبغي لجلال وجهك والعظيم سلطانك فعضلت بالملكين فلم يدريا كيف يكتبانها فصعدا إلى السماء وقالا يا ربنا إن عبدك قد قال مقالة لا ندري كيف نكتبها، قال الله عز وجل وهو أعلم بما قال عبده: ماذا قال عبدي قالا: يا رب إنه قال: يا رب لك الحمد كما ينبغي لجلال وجهك والعظيم سلطانك، فقال الله عز وجل لهما: اكتباها كما قال عبدي حتى يلقاني فأجزيه بها.

Abdullah Ibn Umar رضي الله عنه reported that: 

The Prophet ﷺ informed them: Once a certain slave of Allāh said: 

"O Allāh, All praise belongs to you, as befits the Glory of Your Countenance and the greatness of Your Might."

The Angels became perplexed not knowing how to write down [the reward of ] it.

They then ascended to the sky and said: "O Our Lord, Your slave has uttered discharge a statement we are unsure how to write down [its reward]."

Allāh then said (and He Most Knowledgeable of what His slave speaks): "What did my slave say?"

The Angels reply: "O Allāh, All praise belongs to you, as befits the Glory of Your Countenance and the greatness of Your Might."

Allāh then said: "Write it down just as My slave has uttered it. When he meets Me, I shall reward him for it."

03/04/2025, 11:21 pm - +91 80868 21261: Ziyadat al-Thiqah (زيادة الثقة) is an Arabic term meaning "the addition by a trustworthy narrator." In the science of Hadith (Islamic tradition studies), it refers to extra words or details in a narration that are reported by a reliable (thiqah) narrator but not found in other versions of the same Hadith.

Ruling on Ziyadat al-Thiqah:

1. Accepted (Maqbool) if it does not contradict stronger narrations – If a trustworthy narrator adds extra information that aligns with established narrations, scholars generally accept it.


2. Rejected (Mardood) if it contradicts stronger narrations – If the addition conflicts with more authentic or widely accepted reports, it is usually rejected.


3. Analyzed based on context – Scholars compare the chain of narrators (isnad) and content (matn) to determine whether to accept or reject the addition.

The Messenger of Allah ﷺ  said:

04/04/2025, 6:44 am - Alfaaz: After praying fajr , if men prayed in mosque and women prayed at their home they must remain at their same place TILL sunrise 
I'm not sure which app you use to check prayer timings but if u check the app they'll be a section "sunrise" and today it shows 6:17 it'll be shown on the mosques prayer timings screen as well , this timing 6:17 is when the sun BEGINS to rise but the time for duha is after 15-20 mins after sunrise 
Hence one must sit in the same place remembering Allah(reciting Quran,doing adkhar,doing dhikr,making Dua etc) till 15-20 mins after sunrise ( for today it would be 6:32 ) and pray 4 rakat duha. Duha is a very highly recommend prayer and it has the most benefit when prayer 4 rakat there's various hadiths regarding duha and all Sunnah prayers ( exp 4 before dhur ) these prayers are better prayed 2 by 2 but it is permissible if u pray 4 rakat with one taslim. This is due to this Hadith below

They quoted as evidence for that the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him), according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The prayers of the day and night are to be offered two by two.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 597; Abu Dawood, 1295; al-Nasaa’i, 1666; Ibn Maajah, 1322. This hadeeth was classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani in Tamaam al-Mannah, p. 240.

so in summary , remain in the same place after praying after and remember Allah SWT till 15-20 mins after sunrise then pray 4 rakat duha with 2 taslims , 2 rakat end then prayer then 2 rakat

06/04/2025, 6:04 pm - محمد مبشر: Ayat al-Kursi: The Greatest Protection

Virtue
Ubayy b. Kaʿb (raḍiy Allāhu ʿanhu) reported that he had a vessel in which he kept dates. He found that its quantity was decreasing. So he kept guard on it one night and saw a creature that resembled an adolescent boy. Ubayy greeted him and he returned his greeting. Ubayy then asked him, “What are you, a jinnī or a human?” He replied, “A jinnī.” So he said to him, “Show me your hand.” So he showed him his hand, and it looked like a dog’s paw with dog’s fur. He said, “This is how the jinn are created. The jinn know that there is no one amongst them who is stronger than me.”

Ubayy asked him, “What caused you to do what you did?” He replied, “We heard that you are a man who loves charity, and we came to take our share from your food.’” Ubayy asked him, “What will protect us from you?” He replied, “Reading Āyah al-Kursī from Sūrah al-Baqarah [i.e. the verse above]. If you read it in the morning, you will be protected from us till the evening. And if you read it in the evening, you will be protected from us till the morning.”

Ubayy said: “The following morning, I went to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and told him about what had happened. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, “The evil one spoke the truth.” (Ḥākim 2064)

When the waiting period of Fatimah bint Qays was completed, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to Muawiyah, “Take her in marriage on the condition that you treat her well,” so he married her, and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ loved Muawiyah.

08/04/2025, 8:33 pm - +91 84930 49133: Narrated `Ikrima bin Khalid:

Ibn `Umar said, "I went to Hafsa while water was dribbling from her twined braids. I said, 'The condition of the people is as you see, and no authority has been given to me.' Hafsa said, (to me), 'Go to them, and as they (i.e. the people) are waiting for you, and I am afraid your absence from them will produce division amongst them.' " So Hafsa did not leave Ibn `Umar till we went to them. When the people differed. Muawiya addressed the people saying, "'If anybody wants to say anything in this matter of the Caliphate, he should show up and not conceal himself, for we are more rightful to be a Caliph than he and his father." On that, Habib bin Masalama said (to Ibn `Umar), "Why don't you reply to him (i.e. Muawiya)?" `Abdullah bin `Umar said, "I untied my garment that was going round my back and legs while I was sitting and was about to say, 'He who fought against you and against your father for the sake of Islam, is more rightful to be a Caliph,' but I was afraid that my statement might produce differences amongst the people and cause bloodshed, and my statement might be interpreted not as I intended. (So I kept quiet) remembering what Allah has prepared in the Gardens of Paradise (for those who are patient and prefer the Hereafter to this worldly life)." Habib said, "You did what kept you safe and secure (i.e. you were wise in doing so).

God’s Messenger was detained one morning from observing the prayer with us till the sun had almost appeared over the horizon. He then came cut quickly, and when the iqama had been uttered he conducted the prayer in a shortened form; then when he had given the salutation he called out to us saying, “Keep to your rows as you were.” Then turning to us he said, “I shall tell you what detained me from you this morning. I got up during the night, performed ablution, and prayed what I could; but during my prayer I dozed and was overcome, and there and then I saw my Lord in the most beautiful form. He addressed me by name, and when I replied, ‘At Thy service, my Lord,’ He asked, ‘What do the angels near My presence dispute about?’ and I replied that I did not know. He asked it three times. Then I saw Him put the palm of His hand between my shoulder-blades, so that I experienced the coolness of His fingers between my nipples so everything became clear to me and I attained knowledge. He then addressed me by name, and when I replied, ‘At Thy service, my Lord,’ He asked, ‘What do the angels near My presence dispute about?’ I replied, ‘Expiation.’ He asked what they were, and I replied, ‘Walking on foot to the congregational prayers, sitting in the mosques after the prayers are over, and performing complete ablution in difficult circumstances. He asked what next they disputed about, and when I said it was about degrees, He asked what they were and I replied, ‘Providing food, speaking gently, and praying at night when people are asleep.’ He then told me to make a request, and I said, ‘O God, I ask Thee for power to do good things and abandon objectionable things, for love towards the poor, that Thou shouldest forgive me and show mercy to me, and that when Thou intendest to test any people Thou wilt take me to Thyself without being led astray. And I ask for Thy love, the love of those who love Thee, and a love of doing things which will bring me near to Thy love.’” Then God’s Messenger said, “It is true, so study it and learn it

سعيد بن المسيب قال: “إن الرجل ليصلي بالليل، فيجعل الله في وجهه نورًا يحبه عليه كل مسلم، فيراه من لم يره قط فيقول: إني لأحب هذا الرجل.”

Sa’id ibn al-Musayyib said: “A person may pray at night, and Allah places light on his face that every Muslim who sees him loves him. Someone who has never seen him before may say: ‘Indeed, I love this person.’”

قيل للحسن البصري: “ما بال المتهجدين بالليل من أحسن الناس وجوهًا؟” فقال: “لأنهم خلوا بالرحمن فألبسهم من نوره.” ￼

Al-Hasan al-Basri was asked: “Why do those who pray at night have the most beautiful faces?” He replied: “Because they seclude themselves with the Most Merciful, so He adorns them with His light.”

*[Males only]*

1) Try to send the quote (Arabic preferably) in text form

2) Try to mention how you want the answer to be beforehand (summarised, takhrīj, scan, voice message etc) to avoid back and forth and wastage of time

3) You are allowed only one question within 24H as checking authenticity takes time

4) Avoid messages that are not related to authenticity. Take them to private 

5) Try to consolidate your question in one single message, be clear and unambiguous 

6) Try to search (and mention) the reference beforehand (if possible) to reduce workload on the answerer. Please do not ask about quotes generated by AI

7) Wait for the answer instead of tagging/reminders as they will not give a quicker reply

*Note:* There can be a difference of opinion on the grading but I won't necessarily mention it.
Corrections are welcome privately

Ibrahim Menk is a relative of ‘Mufti’ Menk - who is a staunch Hanafi and was refuted by Shaykh Wasiuallah - It is not common knowledge but ‘Mufti’ Menk responded by trying to remove the Shaykh from the Haram (which simply isn’t possible as Shaykh Wasiullah was put in place by the King of Saudiyyah and can only be removed by him). 

Regardless, if you read the biography of the scholars of ahle hadees in the subcontinent you will find many a times Muqalids deceiving their own followers and falsifying narrations - a famous example being when a former deobandi scholar was informed by his seniors that when Imam Bukhari remained silent about a specific individual it is his best praise, when in reality this is the most severe jarh. 

This is why we take care when we are seeking knowledge - and you guys are blessed to have Muzammil Bhai, May Allah reward him.

12/04/2025, 7:47 am - Alfaaz: 📍A Powerful Fatwa on Healing the Soul

Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (رحمه الله) was asked:

_“What is the cure for someone overtaken by his desires? What should someone do who is overcome by confusion, laziness and distractions? He wants to turn to Allah, but his own self pulls him back. He tries to reflect, but his thoughts scatter. He wants to act, but he's too weak to follow through…”_

Ibn Taymiyyah رحمه الله responded:

“The cure is to turn to Allah sincerely, to keep calling on Him with humility, especially using the authentic du’as at the times when dua is more likely to be accepted — like the last part of the night, between adhan and iqamah, in sujood, and after prayers.
He should also keep making istighfar (seeking forgiveness), because Allah promised: ‘Whoever seeks forgiveness and repents, Allah will grant him a good life.’

Let him have a daily routine of dhikr — morning, evening, and before sleep — and be patient with whatever distractions and difficulties come. If he’s consistent, Allah will support him with His Spirit and plant faith in his heart.

He must give special care to praying the five daily prayers, properly with heart and body — for they are the backbone of the religion.

Let his constant words be:
‘La hawla wa la quwwata illa billah (There is no power or strength except with Allah).’
With these words, one can carry burdens, face hardships, and rise to higher states.
And never give up on making dua. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: ‘A person’s dua is answered as long as he doesn’t give up and say: I made dua but didn’t get an answer.’

Victory comes with patience. Relief comes with hardship. Ease comes with difficulty. No one ever achieved anything great — prophet or otherwise — without patience.”

قال الإمام أحمد بن حنبل : ينبغي للعبد في هذا الزمان أنْ يستدين ويتزوَّج؛ لئلَّا ينظر إلى ما لا يحلُّ، فيحبط عمله. 

In this era, a servant of Allāh should take on debt and get married, lest he gazes upon what is unlawful and thereby nullifies his deeds.

Is this Ṣaḥīḥ?

12/04/2025, 7:57 pm - Mohamed Ahmed Abdulwahab: meaning is obviously wrong because there was no madhab in the prophet's time 😐

Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (رحمه الله) was asked:

_“What is the cure for someone overtaken by his desires? What should someone do who is overcome by confusion, laziness and distractions? He wants to turn to Allah, but his own self pulls him back. He tries to reflect, but his thoughts scatter. He wants to act, but he's too weak to follow through…”_

Ibn Taymiyyah رحمه الله responded:

“The cure is to turn to Allah sincerely, to keep calling on Him with humility, especially using the authentic du’as at the times when dua is more likely to be accepted — like the last part of the night, between adhan and iqamah, in sujood, and after prayers.
He should also keep making istighfar (seeking forgiveness), because Allah promised: ‘Whoever seeks forgiveness and repents, Allah will grant him a good life.’

Let him have a daily routine of dhikr — morning, evening, and before sleep — and be patient with whatever distractions and difficulties come. If he’s consistent, Allah will support him with His Spirit and plant faith in his heart.

He must give special care to praying the five daily prayers, properly with heart and body — for they are the backbone of the religion.

Let his constant words be:
‘La hawla wa la quwwata illa billah (There is no power or strength except with Allah).’
With these words, one can carry burdens, face hardships, and rise to higher states.
And never give up on making dua. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: ‘A person’s dua is answered as long as he doesn’t give up and say: I made dua but didn’t get an answer.’

Victory comes with patience. Relief comes with hardship. Ease comes with difficulty. No one ever achieved anything great — prophet or otherwise — without patience.”
